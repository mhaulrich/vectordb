Index size:
Default is 1024MB, we should at least use the same. (And not 32 as currently)

IVFLAT @ 10⁹ x 128D:
	- nProbe: 8-32
	- nList: 16384
	- GPU only better when #queryvecs > 1000
	Calc = nList + (TOTAL_VEC / nList) * nProbe


Milvus supports partitions tags. I.e. we can tag all inserted vectors with a partition - e.g. source, or codeword.
This allows us to confine searches to specific partitions, e.g. only within one codeword or source. Even supports
regex.

Figure 11 shows that the greater ef-parameter, the greater recall.
In a 4D case ef=2,6,11 give 0.9, 0.99, 0.999 recall respectively.
